# Plague-Runner-Game


Project that I did to create a simple platformer game using Unity and C++ language. Made use of assets to create landscape and obsticles as well as animating character 
movement. Used physics based code to adjust falling speeds and movement speed as well as implementing double jump, dashing, and wall climbing/holding.



# Controls

Movement: Arrow Keys (Holding UP arrow key will slow falling)

Jump: Space

Hold Walls: Z

Dash: X
